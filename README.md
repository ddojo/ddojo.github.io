## Data Dojo Würzburg

# About
Monthly meeting to do **collaborative**, **hands-on** data analytics **training**.
We strive to be an open and inclusive community, everyone is welcome! We have a [code of conduct](./CodeOfConduct) that we adhere to.

Everyone is welcome to join, whether you are a student, researcher or practitioner from industry.

# When and Where

# Process

| 3 h | Example Process |
|-------|------|
| 15 min | welcome, ice breaker |
| 15 min | select datenset  |

| 15 min | split in small sub-groups |
| 90 min | analyze, coding-dojo-style |
| 30 min | present results, recap |

## What is coding-dojo style?

We envision a process similar to the one described as [RandoriKata](https://codingdojo.org/RandoriKata/) but tailored towards data analysis rather than programming. So roughly:
 - After deciding on a dataset, question and tool and splitting into small sub-groups of ~5 people
 - Two people step up to the keyboard and begin analyzing the data as driver (the one typing and clicking) and copilot (giving instructions to the driver)
 - They start from scratch, doing baby steps and explaining everything they do to the audiance
 - After a fixed time period (e.g. 3 or 5 minutes) the roles change, the copilot becomes the driver, someone from the audiance becomes copilot
 - Everyone present is expected to follow what is going on, and make helpful suggestions

# Topics
Each event we will analyze a different dataset. We might use different tools to address different questions about this data. You can add suggestions for datasets/questions/tools to the pad or look beforehand what others have suggested.
