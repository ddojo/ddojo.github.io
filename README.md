# When and Where
Every 6 weeks on Wednesday, in the CCTB seminar series from 11:00 am to 12:30 pm live at the [CCTB Würzburg](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Center+for+Computational+and+Theoretical+Biology+%28CCTB%29,+University+of+W%C3%BCrzburg/@49.7851224,9.9708763,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47a28fc802e5e8d9:0x6b62d2cbd2e6f094).

### Attention! We are currently testing the integration into the CCTB seminar series. The Data Dojo is still open to everyone who is interested.

# Process

| 90 min | Example Process                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 15 min | initial exploration, questions                   |
| 60 min | analyze, coding-dojo-style (in small sub-groups) |
| 15 min | present results, recap                           |

## What is coding-dojo style?

We envision a process similar to the one described as [RandoriKata](https://codingdojo.org/RandoriKata/) but tailored towards data analysis rather than programming. So roughly:
 - After deciding on a dataset, question and tool and splitting into small sub-groups of 3-5 people
 - Two people step up to the keyboard and begin analyzing the data as driver (the one typing and clicking) and copilot (giving instructions to the driver)
 - They start from scratch, doing small steps and explaining everything they do to the audiance
 - After 5 minutes the roles change, the copilot becomes the driver, someone from the audiance becomes copilot
 - Everyone present is expected to follow what is going on, and make helpful suggestions

## Will the Data Dojo be in English or German?

The language of the session depends on the participants. Again we want to be as inclusive as possible. In case there are some participants who can't speak English and others who can't speak German we will split up into sub-groups early.

# Topics
Each event we will analyze a different dataset. We might use different tools to address different questions about this data. You can add suggestions for datasets/questions/tools to the pad or look beforehand what others have suggested.
