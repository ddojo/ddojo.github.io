## Towards DataDojo 2.0

In the CCTB general assembly in April 2025, we decided to make some changes to the DataDojo to  make it more valuable and fun.
This is what we'll try first:
- everyone reads the two-page [Points of Significance](https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/pointsofsignificance) paper [Importance of being uncertain](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2613) before the event
- on May 7 we meet at 11 in the large seminar room (regular seminar time) and discuss the content of the paper for roughly 15 minutes
- then we split into pairs - each pair works together on one machine to reproduce one of the figures (probably Fig. 2) for roughly 60 minutes - I will provide the required data
- then we meet again and every pair shares their result and lessons learned. This takes another 15 minutes

So, as before, it will be hands-on and 90 minutes, so feel free to bring your lunch. But it will be more focused and with smaller groups.

## Assign pairs

- [python pair shuffler](https://marimo.app/l/svx4c6)
- [Uiua pair shuffler](https://www.uiua.org/pad?src=0_16_0-dev_2__IkNhcm8gU2FzY2hhIERoYXJ1IgrijYnirJoiIuKGr-KKnzLijIjDtzLiirjip7vCsOKNhuKKnOKWoeKKuOKJoEAgCg==)

## Dataset

Please read [Importance of being uncertain](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2613) before the dojo.

### Comprehension Questions

- what is the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?
- what is the difference between standard deviation and standard error?
- what is the difference between μ and X̄ (or σ and s)?
- what is a sampling distribution?
- what does the central limit theorem state?

### Task

Reproduce Figure 2 using [the provided data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddojo/ddojo.github.io/refs/heads/main/sessions/33_PoS_uncertain/fig3.tsv) (adjusted from Supplementary Table 1).

### Getting started

- [Marimo notebook (wasm)](https://marimo.app/l/10z7rz)
- [R script](https://github.com/ddojo/ddojo.github.io/blob/main/sessions/33_PoS_uncertain/getting_started.R) (runnable in [webr](https://webr.r-wasm.org/latest/))

### Further ideas

- reproduce any of the other figures
- make your figures interactive
- add explanatory text

## Collaborative Tools and Workflow

Use your own device or [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com).
Free choice of programming language, libraries, and tools.

## Future Suggestions
> Feel free to add suggestions to the list.

### Points of Significance

Go through the papers of the [Points of Significance](https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/pointsofsignificance) series.

### Points of View

Go through the papers of the [Points of View](https://communities.springernature.com/posts/data-visualization-a-view-of-every-points-of-view-column) series.

### Book club

Go through chapters of one of these books

- [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/)
- [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/)
