## Collaborative Tools and Workflow

For Notebooks (R, python, julia, js, ...) with real time collaboration [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) seems to be the best option right now. It worked great last time so we'll stick to it for now. You need to register an account there (it is free).

### Other real time collaboration tools

Feel free to add suggestions to this list

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Live Share Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) (very promising but notebook support not yet stable), languages: python, R, julia, ...
- Jupyter Lab [real time collaboration](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/10118) (alpha feature), languages: python, R, julia, ...
- Observable [multiplayer](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introducing-observable-collaboration) (experimental feature), languages: javascript
- [Jupyter Lite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): in browser version of Jupyter Lab, languages: javascript, (a subset of) python
