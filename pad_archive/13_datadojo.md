## Dataset

Spotify listening history ([request yours here](https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/account/privacy/))

Question Pool:
- Generic
    - What kind of information is stored in the table(s)?
    - How much data is missing?
    - Is the dataset clean or are there any clear outliers?
    - How can the different datasets be combined?
    - How to visualize the results in a suitable way?
- Specific
    - Which artists/songs were most popular during the day vs in the evening?
    - What was the listening frequency for a specific band per year? e.g. Spice Girls
    - What is the top song of each year?
    - Which song was most frequently played in a single day/week/month?
    - What was the longest time a song was not played before being played again?
    - How many different songs and artists did we listen to (by year)?
    - Which artists were most popular in summer/winter?
    - **Add your own questions**
- Further Ideas
    - What is the most skipped song all time?
    - Is there a temporal correlation between songs/artists? (probably yes, because of playlists...)
    - Can we predict the year based on a selection of five random songs?
    - **Add your own ideas**

## Collaborative Tools and Workflow

For Notebooks (R, python, julia, js, ...) with real time collaboration [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) seems to be the best option right now. It worked great the last couple of times so we'll stick to it for now. You need to register an account there (it is free).
