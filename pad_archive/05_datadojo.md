## Dataset

We'll use the same data set as in September as we barely scratched the surface:

Hourly temperature in Würzburg from 1948 to 2021 (and Kitzingen from 2005 to 2021).

Data access: https://cdc.dwd.de/portal

A pre-downloaded file is available [here](https://ddojo.github.io/sessions/04_weather/cdc_download_2021-09-09_09-30.zip).

Question Pool:
- Generic
    - What kind of information is stored in the table?
    - How much data is missing?
    - Is the dataset clean or are there any clear outliers?
- Specific
    - What (and when) was the hottest/coldest temperature ever meassured in Würzburg
    - What was the hottest/coldest day/week/month/year (sliding window)?
    - What was the most extreme temperature difference within 24 hours?
    - Is there a long term trend in mean temperature?
    - Is there a difference in temperature per month (shifting seasons)?
    - **Add your own questions**
- Further Ideas
    - How well can we predict the temparature of the next day/week/month?
    - Include precipitation or more weather stations from Germany/Europe/World &rarr; maybe another time

## Collaborative Tools and Workflow

For Notebooks (R, python, julia, js, ...) with real time collaboration [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) seems to be the best option right now. It worked great the last couple of times so we'll stick to it for now. You need to register an account there (it is free).

### Other real time collaboration tools

Feel free to add suggestions to this list

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Live Share Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) (very promising but notebook support not yet stable), languages: python, R, julia, ...
- Jupyter Lab [real time collaboration](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/10118) (alpha feature), languages: python, R, julia, ...
- Observable [multiplayer](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introducing-observable-collaboration) (experimental feature), languages: javascript
- [Jupyter Lite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): in browser version of Jupyter Lab, languages: javascript, (a subset of) python
