## General Question

Should we decide on a tool/programming language and collaboration workflow beforehand?
Maybe even stick to one programming language?
Idea: people can add their preferred language/tool upon sign-up. If there are at least three participants with the same preference they'll use that in a break out room. If there are not enough people for a tool they can join other rooms or agree on using any other tool together.

## Collaborative Tools and Workflow

For Notebooks (R, python, julia, js, ...) with real time collaboration [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) seems to be the best option right now. It worked great last time so we'll stick to it for now. You need to register an account there (it is free).

### Real time collaboration tools

Feel free to add suggestions to this list

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Live Share Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) (very promising but notebook support currently broken), languages: python, R, julia, ...
<details>
Unfortunately, notebook support with VS Code Live Share is an experimental feature which is currently broken (but expected to be fixed soon): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/notebooks and https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/4291. Update: on June 22, this issue was anounced as fixed. Unfortunately there is a new (unrelated) issue that prevents notebook output from being shown for guests: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/4342. This issue is being worked on...

Once this is available, it seams to be the ideal solution especially as it has a unified interface independent of the language (python/julia/R/...)

<!-- :warning: It would be helpful if you could install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Live Share Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) before hand. -->

> If notebook support is fixed the [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) version would be required as long as it is experimental. This can be installed alongside regular VS Code without problems.

- Jupyter Lab [real time collaboration](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/10118) (alpha feature), languages: python, R, julia, ...
- Observable [multiplayer](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introducing-observable-collaboration) (experimental feature), languages: javascript

## Dataset

[UN Votes](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-03-23/readme.md)

Question Pool:
- Generic
    - What kind of information is stored in the table?
    - How much data is missing?
    - Is the dataset clean or are there any clear outliers?
- Specific
    - Which country has the highest fraction of "Yes" ("No") votes?
    - How did the fraction of "Yes" votes change over time for each country (by topic)?
    - Which pair of countries (dis)agrees the most?
    - What are the topics of the votes that Germany voted "No"?
    - Which vote had the least amount of "Yes" votes?
    - What was the amount of general agreement over the years?
    - How many votes went unanimous?
- Further Ideas
    - Create a world map where you can select a year and countries will be color coded based on the fraction of "Yes" votes in that year
    - Same map as before but you can select specific votes and see the "Yes"/"No"/"Abstain" per country
    - Country graph with connections depending on the correlation of voting behaviour
