## Collaborative Tools and Workflow

We have not found the ideal solution, yet. Some options are available as preview features but not stable, yet. **So this time we will likely start with plain Zoom screen sharing**, we'll switch to something different based on participant interest: probably [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com).

### Real time collaboration tools

Feel free to add suggestions to this list

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Live Share Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) (very promising but notebook support currently broken), languages: python, R, julia, ...
<details>
Unfortunately, notebook support with VS Code Live Share is an experimental feature which is currently broken (but expected to be fixed soon): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/notebooks and https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/4291. Update: on June 22, this issue was anounced as fixed. Unfortunately there is a new (unrelated) issue that prevents notebook output from being shown for guests: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/4342. This issue is being worked on...

Once this is available, it seams to be the ideal solution especially as it has a unified interface independent of the language (python/julia/R/...)

<!-- :warning: It would be helpful if you could install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Live Share Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) before hand. -->

> If notebook support is fixed the [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) version would be required as long as it is experimental. This can be installed alongside regular VS Code without problems.

- Jupyter Lab [real time collaboration](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/10118) (alpha feature), languages: python, R, julia, ...
- Observable [multiplayer](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introducing-observable-collaboration) (experimental feature), languages: javascript

## Dataset

[Global Power Plant Database](https://github.com/wri/global-power-plant-database/)

-- suggested by Timo, thanks!


Potential Questions:
- Comparison of regions/countries/continents
- Comparison of plant-types/energy sources
- Find additional data to map MW demand vs. production (per region/country/continent)

Question Pool:
- Generic
    - What kind of information is stored in the table?
    - How much data is missing?
    - Is the dataset clean or are there any clear outliers?
- Specific
    - Which country has the highest number of powerplants (how many, top 10)?
    - Which is the country with the highest power preduction (MW) per continent (how much, top 5)
    - What is the overall proportion of each energy source (by plant number, by MW produced)
    - Which is the greenest country (highest fraction of power from renewable sources)?
    - How does the distribution of power plants look on a worldmap (by type, interactive)?
