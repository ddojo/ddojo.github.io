## Towards DataDojo 2.0

In the CCTB general assembly in April 2025, we decided to make some changes to the DataDojo to  make it more valuable and fun.
This is what we currently try:
- everyone reads the announced two-page [Points of Significance](https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/pointsofsignificance) paper before the event
- we meet at 11 in the large seminar room (regular seminar time) and discuss the content of the paper for roughly 15 minutes
- then we split into pairs - each pair works together on one machine to reproduce one of the figures for roughly 60 minutes - I will provide the required data
- then we meet again and every pair shares their result and lessons learned. This takes another 15 minutes

So, as before, it will be hands-on and 90 minutes, so feel free to bring your lunch. But it will be more focused and with smaller groups.

## Assign pairs

Currently a dumb version (does not take experience level and language preferences into account).

## Dataset

This riddle by Martin Gardner:

> I HEAR some youngsters playing in the back yard," said Jones, a graduate student in mathematics. "Are they all yours?"
"Heavens, no," exclaimed Professor Smith, the eminent number theorist. "My children are playing with friends from three other families in the neighborhood, although our family happens to be largest. The Browns have a smaller number of children, the Greens have a still smaller number, and the Blacks the smallest of all."
"How many children are there altogether?" asked Jones.
"Let me put,it this way," said Smith. "There are fewer than 18 children, and the product of the numbers in the four families happens to be my house number which you saw when you arrived."
Jones took a notebook and pencil from his pocket and started scribbling. A moment later he looked up and said, "I need more information. Is there more than one child in the Black family ?"
As soon as Smith replied, Jones smiled and correctly stated the number of children in each family.
Knowing the house number and whether the Blacks had more than one child, Jones found the problem trivial. It is a remarkable fact, however, that the number of children in each family can be determined solely on the basis of the information given above !

### Tasks

#### Task 1 - Solve the riddle with the programming language of your choice

#### Task 2 - Solve the [Josephus Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem) for arbitrary n and k

### Further ideas

- reproduce any of the other figures
- make your figures interactive
- add explanatory text

## Collaborative Tools and Workflow

Use your own device or [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com).
Free choice of programming language, libraries, and tools.
