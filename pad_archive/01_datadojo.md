:exclamation: As a test run it will be shorter, than usual. Please plan for 60 to 90 minutes :exclamation: 

## Collaborative Tools and Workflow

In the first Test Run [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Live Share Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) was found to be a suitable tool for real time collaboration. 

Unfortunately, notebook support with VS Code Live Share is an experimental feature which is currently broken (but expected to be fixed soon): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/notebooks and https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/4291

Once this is available, it seams to be the ideal solution especially as it has a unified interface independent of the language (python/julia/R/...)

:warning: For this test run it would be helpful if you could install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Live Share Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) before hand. 

> If notebook support is fixed the [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) version would be required as long as it is experimental. This can be installed alongside regular VS Code without problems.
