## Are the Data Crunch Magic Events in German or English?

This is decided by the respective expert. So it might change from time to time but it will always be anounced beforehand.

## Topics

There are many tools and languages for data analysis out there. Each has unique strengths and limitations. We let experts demonstrate how to best use their favorite tools. They do it by analyzing a real dataset live.
It is also possible to interact with the experts and other participants, to ask questions, and to discuss.

We are currently planning events with at least these tools:
- R
- julia
- python
- JavaScript
- Microsoft PowerBI
