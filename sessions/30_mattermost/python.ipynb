    "### Task A - most crowded day of the week\n",
    "- estimate the total number of people having lunch (or coffee) at the CCTB/mensa for each day → when was the time that most people went to lunch?\n",
    "- plot the number of people per day over time (also try to summarize by week/month/year)\n",
    "- plot a boxplot for the number of people per day of the week → what is the most crowded day of the week?\n",
    "- make the same plot as above, but separately for every month/year → is there a shift in day of the week preference?\n",
    "- perform a statistical test for the hypothesis: \"Mondays and Fridays are less crowded than Tuesday to Thursday\"\n",
    "- discuss caveats of the data and methods used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task B - lunch time\n",
    "- estimate the time of lunch/coffee for each day → when was the most popular time?\n",
    "    - try to consider proposed times (\"mensa at 12?\", \"11:15?\")\n",
    "    - direct calls (\"mensa?\", \"now\")\n",
    "    - relative times (\"lunch in 5min\", \"mensa in half an hour?\")\n",
    "- plot the lunch time over the years (also try to summarize by week/month/year) → is there a trend (gradual shift or break point(s)) in lunch time?\n",
    "- plot a boxplot for the lunch time per day of the week → is there a difference in lunch time per day of the week?\n",
    "- make the same plot as above, but separately for every month/year → is the pattern above consistent over the year(s)?\n",
    "- perform a statistical test for the hypothesis: \"Lunch time is later during semester break (April,May,August,September) than during lecture period since 2022\"\n",
    "- discuss caveats of the data and methods used\n",

    "### Task C - your own idea\n",
    "If you have other ideas, feel free to follow them, but create a plan similar to that for Task A and B above, before you start."
